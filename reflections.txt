Pg 12:
- a comparison function should be transitive?
- a hash function should use exactly does fields which are used in equality checking?
- Hash, equal, compare functions are good candidates for defered implementation. How to write these exactly and what big differences between compare and equal.

CHAPTER 4
pg 22:
- Great problem solvers have skills that cannot be rigorously formalized
- Patterns: generally reusable solutions to commonly occuring problems
- Data structure is a particular way of storing and organizing related data items so that they can be manipulated efficiently.

pg 23:
- Solutions often require a combination of data structures.
- In computer science, an abstract data type (ADT) is a mathematical model for a certain class of data structures that have similar behavior; or for certain data types of one or more programming languages that have similar semantics
- (ADT) A kind of data abstraction where a type's internal form is hidden behind a set of access functions.

pg 27:
BSTs are a workhorse of data sructures and can be used to solve almost every data structure problem reasonably efficiently

pg 28:
An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure for performing a calculation. An algorithm can be composed of other algorithms.
